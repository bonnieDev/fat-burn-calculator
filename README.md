Fat Burning Calculator
Here's the math:
here’s the full breakdown of how the Fat Burn Calculator works:
1️⃣ Finding Your Ideal Fat-Burning Zone (BPM)
Your maximum heart rate (MaxHR) is estimated as:
MaxHR
=
220
−
age
MaxHR=220−age
Your fat-burning zone (where the body is most efficient at using stored fat) is about 60%-70% of MaxHR:
Fat Burn BPM
=
0.6
×
MaxHR
to
0.7
×
MaxHR
Fat Burn BPM=0.6×MaxHRto0.7×MaxHR
2️⃣ How Many Calories You Burn Per Minute
Your body burns calories based on MET values (Metabolic Equivalent of Task), which is activity-dependent.
Calories Burned Per Min
=
(
MET
×
Weight in Kg
×
3.5
200
)
Calories Burned Per Min=(
200
MET×Weight in Kg×3.5
​
)
🛠 MET values by heart rate zone:
Fat burn zone (60%-70%) → 5.0 METs
Above fat burn zone (>70%) → 8.0 METs
Below fat burn zone (<60%) → 3.5 METs
Your weight in kg is calculated as:
Weight in Kg
=
Weight in Lbs
2.2
Weight in Kg=
2.2
Weight in Lbs
​
3️⃣ Converting Calories to Fat Burned
🔥 Not all calories burned come from fat. The percentage of calories from fat depends on heart rate:
60%-70% BPM → 60% fat burn
Above 70% BPM → 40% fat burn
Below 60% BPM → 70% fat burn
Fat Calories Per Min
=
Calories Burned Per Min
×
Fat Percentage
Fat Calories Per Min=Calories Burned Per Min×Fat Percentage
Since 1 gram of fat = 9 calories, we calculate:
Fat Burned (g/min)
=
Fat Calories Per Min
9
Fat Burned (g/min)=
9
Fat Calories Per Min
​
4️⃣ Fat Burned Over Time
We convert grams per minute into pounds per hour:
Fat Burned (lbs/hr)
=
Fat Burned (g/min)
×
60
453.592
Fat Burned (lbs/hr)=
453.592
Fat Burned (g/min)×60
​
5️⃣ How Long to Burn 1 Teaspoon of Fat? 🥄
Since 1 teaspoon of fat = 4.5 grams, we calculate:
Minutes to Burn One Teaspoon
=
4.5
Fat Burned (g/min)
Minutes to Burn One Teaspoon=
Fat Burned (g/min)
4.5

Would love feedback! What do you think of this fat-burn metric? Would knowing this make you more motivated? 🧐 I like knowing things like - if i do this for 8 more minutes i will burn a teaspoon of fat off of my body lol.
